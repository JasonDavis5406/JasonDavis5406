## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) specializing in using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor and maintain the reliability of applications and infrastructure. This repository showcases my work in setting up effective alerting, building robust monitoring systems, and creating custom dashboards to ensure systems remain highly available and performant. Whether you're an SRE, DevOps engineer, or just interested in application reliability, this repo provides valuable resources for managing your monitoring stack.

A key focus of my work is setting up alerting using Prometheus and Alertmanager. I configure alerts based on key metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, response times, and error rates, ensuring that potential issues are detected early before they impact users. With well-defined thresholds and alert routing to platforms like Slack or PagerDuty, I ensure that the right teams are notified promptly for quick resolution, minimizing downtime and disruptions.

In addition to alerting, I focus heavily on monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus. I implement robust collection of metrics across different systems and services, including Kubernetes clusters, databases, and network devices. Using Prometheus exporters and custom instrumentation, I ensure that the monitoring solution is comprehensive, providing visibility into the health of the entire infrastructure.

Finally, I specialize in creating custom Grafana dashboards that visualize critical metrics in a user-friendly way. I design and configure dashboards that allow teams to quickly identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and track key performance indicators (KPIs). By using Grafana's templating and alerting features, I enable dynamic and actionable visualizations that improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to the projects in this repository. I hope you find these tools helpful in enhancing your own monitoring and reliability practices. Thanks for checking out my work!
